        I am a Web Developer who studied Full-Stack Web Development with a focus
        on Javascript and Javascript frameworks.
        <br />
        <br />
        Before starting web development, I spent 10 years as a Financial
        Professional for brokerage firms in New York City and Salt Lake City.
        After a successful career in Financial Services, I was drawn to the
        creative and analytical aspects of writing code. I find coding to be 
        an iteresting intersection, where creativity and analytics come together.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to writing code, I also enjoy writing and playing music.
